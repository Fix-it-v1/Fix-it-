“Our project aims to develop an easy-to-use and effective mobile application called “Fix It”
Providing an easy and convenient way to locate and hire nearby home repair technicians.
The app is designed for homeowners or renters who are facing common household problems like repairing electrical appliances, plumbing, carpentry, etc.
Users can create service requests, view profiles of nearby technicians, and track their service status in real time.
Technicians have profiles where their experiences and ratings are presented to allow users to choose a reliable technician, by assisting in submitting service requests and technicians,
As we aim to provide users with a smooth and efficient service experience, the application will be built with the latest technologies and programming languages for the best user experience.
